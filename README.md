# ITSM-incident-management
This project is a client project which has four cases to be handled for ABC tech client. 
In this project firstly there was a need to predict high priority, so that client can take preventive measures or fix the problem before it surfaces
Next case was to forecast incident volume in differejnt fields, quaterly and annualy, so that they can be better prepared with resources and technology.
In next case there was a need to autotag tickets with right priority and right departments, so that issue of reassigning is reduced and delay can be reduced
Final case is to predict Request for change and possible failure or missconfiguration of ITSM assets
